abstract = {Graduate students are facing a mental health crisis due to a combination of individual, community, and societal factors. Many existing stress management interventions engage with one factor at a time, typically focusing on providing a user with data about their stress state. We conducted co-design workshops with graduate students who work closely together to explore their strategies for managing stress and to learn about what types of technologies they envision to help address their stress. Using Ecological Systems Theory as an conceptual framework, our analysis of the designs and discussions from these workshops contributes an expanded design space for stress management—one that foregrounds the affordances and challenges of designing interventions that cut across ecological systems levels along with designs that approach stress management using a broader diversity of strategies: controlling, disconnecting, and normalizing stress. We argue that this expanded design space embraces a more holistic and human approach to designing stress management technologies.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally changed the nature of work by shifting most in-person work to a predominantly remote modality. As boundaries between home and workspaces became blurred, people have to renegotiate various aspects of work and personal life. In my thesis, drawing on reflective design that emphasizes the value of human interpretation in meaning-making, I investigate how technologies can leverage reflection to support remote workers’ wellness. My thesis consists of a set of interrelated studies, including empirical and design research, which will help me explore the role of technology for the art of living in an uncertain world.},
