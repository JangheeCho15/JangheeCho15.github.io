Many existing stress management interventions engage with one factor at a time, typically focusing on providing a user with data about their stress state. We conducted co-design workshops with graduate students who work closely together to explore their strategies for managing stress and to learn about what types of technologies they envision to help address their stress. Using Ecological Systems Theory as an conceptual framework, our analysis of the designs and discussions from these workshops contributes an expanded design space for stress management—one that foregrounds the affordances and challenges of designing interventions that cut across ecological systems levels along with designs that approach stress management using a broader diversity of strategies: controlling, disconnecting, and normalizing stress. We argue that this expanded design space embraces a more holistic and human approach to designing stress management technologies.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="10.1145/3532107.3532872" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Design for Domestic Uncertainty: Envisioning Future Technologies in the Work-From-Home Era That Support Reflective Practices</div> <div class="author"> Janghee Cho</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Companion Publication of the 2022 ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference</em>, Sep 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally changed the nature of work by shifting most in-person work to a predominantly remote modality.

The lack of features that encourage user-driven reflection, scaffolding for setting goals and configuring data collection and presentation, and consideration of wider implications stand to limit meaning-making and frustrate nuanced insight generation based on lived experiences.

In the process, the shift to working-from-home rapidly forced the large-scale adoption of groupware technologies. Although prior empirical research examined the experience of working-from-home within small-scale groups and for targeted kinds of work, the pandemic provides HCI and CSCW researchers with an unprecedented opportunity to understand the psycho-social impacts of a universally mandated work-from-home experience rather than an autonomously chosen one. Drawing on boundary theory and a methodological approach grounded in humanistic geography, we conducted a qualitative analysis of Reddit data drawn from two work-from-home-related subreddits between March 2020 and January 2021. In this paper, we present a characterization of the challenges and solutions discussed within these online communities for adapting work to a hybrid or fully remote modality, managing reconfigured work-life boundaries, and reconstructing the home’s sense of place to serve multiple, sometimes conflicting roles. We discuss how these findings suggest an emergent interplay among adapted work practice, reimagined physical (and virtual) spaces, and the establishment and continual re-negotiation of boundaries as a means for anticipating the long-term impact of COVID on future conceptualizations of productivity and work.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="10.1145/3411763.3451838" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">From The Art of Reflection to The Art of Noticing: A Shifting View of Self-Tracking Technologies’ Role in Supporting Sustainable Food Practices</div> <div class="author"> Janghee Cho, Laura Devendorf, and Stephen Voida</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Extended Abstracts of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</em>, Jan 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This paper explores the possibility of using self-tracking technologies to promote sustainable food habits. To explore socio-cultural aspects in food practices and to understand the potential role of self-tracking tools in participants’ everyday lives, we designed and deployed a probe kit with seven participants. We found that (1) participants had differing, and at times conflicting, conceptions of what made their diet sustainable; (2) they viewed self-tracking tools as an unobtrusive means to help them achieve a goal–but didn’t report that those goals were ever met; and (3) they expressed strong associations between particular eating behaviors and rituals and/or holidays. Reflecting on the results and the concept of design (in)action, we suggest an alternative way of designing self-tracking tools for self-reflection (i.e., the art of noticing) that might help people draw attention to the impact of their food practices on the environment. We conclude by recommending a shift in focus from traditional and “always-on” self-tracking solutions to everyday practices, holidays, or rituals in which a technological tool could bring more attention to a particular facet of food sustainability.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="cho2021potential" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">How potential new members approach an online community</div> <div class="author"> Janghee Cho, and Rick Wash</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)</em>, Jan 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="cho2020envisioning" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Envisioning new productivity tools for domestic information work environments</div> <div class="author"> Janghee Cho, and Stephen Voida</div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> Jan 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="10.1145/3392838" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The Role of Conversational Grounding in Supporting Symbiosis Between People and Digital Assistants</div> <div class="author"> Janghee Cho, and Emilee Rader</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Proc.

However, many new users give up quickly and limit their use to a few simple tasks. This is a problem for both the user and the system. Users who stop trying out new things cannot learn about new features and functionality, and the system receives less data upon which to base future improvements. Symbiosis—a mutually beneficial relationship—between AI systems like digital assistants and people is an important aspect of developing systems that are partners to humans and not just tools. In order to better understand requirements for symbiosis, we investigated the relationship between the types of digital assistant responses and users’ subsequent questions, focusing on identifying interactions that were discouraging to users when speaking with a digital assistant. We conducted a user study with 20 participants who completed a series of information seeking tasks using the Google Home, and analyzed transcripts using a method based on applied conversation analysis. We found that the most common response from the Google Home, a version of "Sorry, I’m not sure how to help”, provided no feedback for participants to build on when forming their next question. However, responses that provided somewhat strange but tangentially related answers were actually more helpful for conversational grounding, which extended the interaction. We discuss the connection between grounding and symbiosis, and present recommendations for requirements for forming partnerships with digital assistants.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2018</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="10.1145/3170427.3180286" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Mental Models and Home Virtual Assistants (HVAs)</div> <div class="author"> Janghee Cho</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Extended Abstracts of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</em>, May 2018 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>This study examines how users interact with Google Home, which is a type of home virtual assistant (HVA). Users are expected to speak to HVAs in a conversational manner; however, there has been little research looking at users’ mental models for what kinds of interactions they think the devices are capable of. To investigate users’ mental models, I conducted user study sessions in which I gave novice users several tasks to complete, and asked them to think aloud as they completed those tasks. I elicited two mental models (push, pull) from verbal strategies they use to complete the task. My findings help to better understand why users may be reluctant to use HVAs, and provide design guidance for future conversational interfaces.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="10.1145/3173574.3173677" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Explanations as Mechanisms for Supporting Algorithmic Transparency</div> <div class="author"> Emilee Rader, Kelley Cotter, and Janghee Cho</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 2018 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems</em>, May 2018 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Transparency can empower users to make informed choices about how they use an algorithmic decision-making system and judge its potential consequences.

We conducted an online experiment focusing on how different ways of explaining Facebook’s News Feed algorithm might affect participants’ beliefs and judgments about the News Feed. We found that all explanations caused participants to become more aware of how the system works, and helped them to determine whether the system is biased and if they can control what they see. The explanations were less effective for helping participants evaluate the correctness of the system’s output, and form opinions about how sensible and consistent its behavior is.

However, the News Feed user interface provides little information to help users understand how the ranking algorithm works. We analyzed the company’s "News Feed FYI’ blog series to better understand the degree to which Facebook employs "how’and "why’ explanations of its News Feed algorithm. These types of explanations have been used in other recommendation and intelligent systems as a means of promoting user understanding and acceptance. Our findings show that the "News Feed" FYI’ blog posts focus more on explanations that justify why the algorithm works the way it does, and less on explanations that describe how the system works. These findings suggest that the "News Feed" FYI’ series would be more helpful for increasing users’ confidence in the system, but not improving their trust in the system.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2023 Janghee Cho.
