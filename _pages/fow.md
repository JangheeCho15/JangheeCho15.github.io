##### *Futures of Work*

The future of work encompasses the transformation of work, the workforce, and workplace paradigms, including the emergence of remote and hybrid work models in response to shifting social and technological landscapes. My research delves into how technology can foster more flexible, inclusive, and adaptive work environments that cater to the diverse needs and aspirations of the workforce. As an illustration, one of my projects envisions the use of future technologies to create sustainable and fulfilling work-from-home arrangements.
