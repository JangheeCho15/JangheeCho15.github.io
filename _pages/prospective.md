I am seeking highly motivated PhD students, undergraduate research assistants, and independent study scholars who are interested in conducting research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and design research, specifically with a critical and sociotechnical approach.

**Important**: I kindly request that you refrain from sending generic emails, as they may not receive a response. I encourage you to take a moment to thoroughly read this page and explore some of my recent research and publications.

When reaching out to me via email for the first time, use the subject line [Prospective]. Additionally, please include a description of your research interests and background, and don't forget to attach your CV or resume, and transcripts (only undergraduate). I appreciate your attention to these details.



#### Prospective PhD Students:

If you are interested in working with me, please apply to National University of Singapore (NUS) Division of Industrial Design (DID) as a PhD student and specify my name as a potential advisor. For more information, including admission requirements, please click [here](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/did/postgraduate/). NUS also provides [various scholarships](https://nusgs.nus.edu.sg/scholarships-list/?pgf) that you may want to explore to determine your eligibility.

I am interested in working on a number of topics listed below. However, this list is by no means exhaustive, and I am seeking students who can generate their own ideas and are passionate about specific research projects aligned with their values and vocation. Some of the research topics of interest include:

<ul>
  <li>Futures of work and the well-being of workers, including work-life balance</li>
  <li>Technology for addressing sustainability challenges and climate change</li>
  <li>Designing for reflection</li>
  <li>Technology design driven by values and cultural heritage from Asia</li>
  <li>Critical, speculative, discursive design for AI-driven technologies </li>
</ul>

While your skill sets and prior experience are crucial for your Ph.D. application, I place additional value on your resilience and open-mindedness in approaching diverse research methodologies. These qualities are essential for making meaningful contributions in the fields of HCI and design. Also, I extend a warm welcome to students, especially those from underrepresented groups in Design and Computing, to reach out and collaborate with me on exploring potential projects together.

#### Undergraduate & Master Students at NUS:

I am constantly seeking self-motivated and enthusiastic undergraduate and master students who are eager to learn and pursue a research-oriented career. Typically, undergraduates are engaged in ongoing projects, participating in design practices, or contributing to computing or technical work, such as system building or coding. However, I also encourage students to apply if they aspire to establish their own research career with me.

For both undergraduate and master's students, various options are available, including roles as research assistants during the semester or research interns. I anticipate a commitment of at least one year from those who join.

#### Visiting Students and Scholars:

I may be able to host visiting students (either undergraduate or graduate) who are not affiliated with NUS, depending on research interests, project needs, and funding availability. A visit can also be a valuable chance for us to understand each other's working styles, particularly if you're applying for my Ph.D.

#### Postdoc:
Currently, I am not actively recruiting postdoctoral researchers, primarily due to the absence of a funded project proposal to allocate a position. Unless you possess a postdoctoral fellowship, regrettably, I am unable to collaborate at this time. Nevertheless, NUS provides several fellowship opportunities (i.e., [Lee Kuan Yew Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.nus.edu.sg/research/research-management/funding-opportunities/lee-kuan-yew-postdoctoral-fellowship) |  [NUS Fellows Programme (Southeast Asia)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/research/funding-opportunities/NUS-fellows-programme-southeast-asia)) that you may want to explore and apply for.
